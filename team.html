      <h2>Anthony Costarelli</h2>
      <p>Just last year I semi-joined robotics. Only now, I am a full member and I'm ready to tackle this year. Especially, I'm excited for learning how to be a leader for next year. So my job on the team is to program, which I'm currently doing alongside Makiah and Jordan. Under Makiah's lead, I feel that we're going to make a great robot. Currently I'm still learning the workflow for programming the robot, but I'm becoming more independent. Keyword: learning. Someday I'll get this all down.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3"> <img class="img-circle" src="images/people/jordan.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="140" height="140">
      <h2>Jordan Arnold</h2>
      <p>Jordan Arnold is a senior at Natick High School. This is his first year in FTC and first year on 3737. His favorite part of the robot is the swerve drive because of the PID that is involved. He joined robotics to apply the mathematics and physics he has learned in high school. Aside from FTC, he competes competitively in swimming competitions. If you do not see him in the workshop or in the swimming pool, your best bet is that he is either sleeping, watching Grey’s Anatomy, or watching the New England Patriots play. He plans to pursue Aeronautics after high school.</p>
