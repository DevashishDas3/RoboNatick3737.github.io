      <h2>Makiah Bennett</h2>
      <p>On the third day of freshman year at Natick High School, Makiah steadied his resolve and marched into the robotics room, wanting to be a programmer.  Three years later, he maintains his programming position, and spends his time making the robot do everything it is supposed to and just a little bit more. During the other 15 minutes of his free time, he learns more about computer science and biology. If all goes according to plan, Makiah will establish himself as the twelfth MIT biotech alumnus who is also a billionaire before age 30.</p>
